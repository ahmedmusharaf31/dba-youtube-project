Drivers are obliged to give each other space, Sainz had that before Checo gave him some more but Sainz just wanted the ideal line the full slipstream with a better position for the next corner.
Never read any rulings that a driver should give up his favorable position if another really wanted to have that spot.
Charles knew Checo was there btw, can't tell me otherwise, he should have seen him in the corner itself and you can see him checking his mirror multiple times while drifting sideways, he just assumed Checo would hand him the better place on the road if he squeezed him more.
Funny btw that if Checo had hit LeClerc because he drifted to far, Checo would be at fault, but if Sainz hits Checo because he drifted to far, Checo's at fault...really can't agree with this one.
Imo Sainz was more at fault eventhough Checo could have avoided it by letting himself be pushed back and give up the duel, why? Because Charles claimed ground that wasn't his and he could have stopped when he saw that Checo gave him a little to avoid the contact but didn't move away completely.
Glad no penalties were handed out though, both drivers already lost this race here and a penalty for the next wouldn't help the other driver, think penalties for subsequent races should only happen if the action was simply far beyond reasonable.","Checo didn&#39;t really hold his line, he was point on the line exit and when Sainz come closer he moved with his right tyre over that same line before contact happened, he gave Sainz some extra space (about 1 meter) but Sainz continued steering to the middle.<br>Drivers are obliged to give each other space, Sainz had that before Checo gave him some more but Sainz just wanted the ideal line the full slipstream with a better position for the next corner.<br>Never read any rulings that a driver should give up his favorable position if another really wanted to have that spot.<br>Charles knew Checo was there btw, can&#39;t tell me otherwise, he should have seen him in the corner itself and you can see him checking his mirror multiple times while drifting sideways, he just assumed Checo would hand him the better place on the road if he squeezed him more.<br>Funny btw that if Checo had hit LeClerc because he drifted to far, Checo would be at fault, but if Sainz hits Checo because he drifted to far, Checo&#39;s at fault...really can&#39;t agree with this one.<br>Imo Sainz was more at fault eventhough Checo could have avoided it by letting himself be pushed back and give up the duel, why?

There's no right or wrong answer, I'm just looking for opinions.
Which strategy do you favor: 
1 -- A one-stopper that requires you to be as kind to the tires as you can for as long as you can, sacrificing some speed in the hopes of gaining time at the end stages of the race, or
2 -- A two-stopper that allows you to go as fast as you can -- basically doing quali laps for the whole race?

1 is obviously safer lap-by-lap, but man, does it ever _feel_ slow. This method definitely requires patience.
2 is a lot more dangerous since you're dancing on the razor's edge the entire time. One mistake, even a relatively minor one, can cost you many places at the end. And getting caught behind any traffic also puts a damper on your strategy, and possibly the outcome.

If you answer, can you say why you chose that way?
Thanks to any who play along.
